Rahul and Tina are a part of the same lecture section for the course CS F111. Their classroom is NAB 6101, which has 11 rows and 12 seats in each row (a 11x12 matrix of seats). Rahul is in love with Tina, and Tina thinks that he is a creep.
As Rahul is very disciplined, he makes sure to be in the classroom much before the class starts, in fact, he is the first to enter the classroom! So, he randomly selects a seat. When Tina comes to the classroom, she makes sure to select a seat as far as possible from Rahul. 
The distance of one seat from the other is defined as the sum of the absolute differences of the row numbers and column numbers of Rahul’s and Tina’s seat respectively. For example, the distance between seat (1, 12) and (5, 8) is |1-5| + |12-8| = 8. What is the difference between the maximum and minimum possible distance between Rahul’s seat and Tina’s seat?
